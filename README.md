# default-ip-index-page
A default index page to show when a user connects to the bare IP, showing all sites on that server.

The default files assume:
- You are running Ubuntu >=20.04 (though may work lower, depending on how Nginx structures directories in those versions)
- You are using Nginx/Apache2 (Apache isn't done yet)
- You have PHP set up and configured in Nginx/Apache (this was written in PHP 8.1 but is likely to work with some past and future versions)
- Your sites in `sites-enabled` are named as `domain.tld.conf`

These settings can easily be modified to fit your system in the `index.php` file, so you don't have to strictly meet these assumptions. Where you are meant to change them, they are pointed out in comments in the code.
